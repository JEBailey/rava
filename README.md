# Rava
Rava assists in website functionality where interactive content is desired as well as a small footprint. See https://www.ravajs.com
## Why
Rava is designed to assist with websites with simple dynamic content where content may be pulled in or generated after the page is rendered.
## How
Rava allows you to bind functions and event handlers to HTML elements defined by a CSS selector. This binding will occur on all existing elements as well as additional elements that are later added to the page.
