# Rava
Rava is a micro library that allows you to modify html
## Why
Rava is designed to assist with websites with simple dynamic content. Where thee is a need to handle dynamically generated or added html but not to the complexity where you would want to implement a framework such as React or Angular. 
## How
Rava allows you to register a configuration against a selector so that this configuration is applied to all matching elements. It then registers itself and monitors for any additional matching elements that may be dynamically added after the first call, which makes it extremely useful for content that is being pulled in asynchronously.
