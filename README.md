# Rava
Rava assists in website functionality where interactive content is required as well as a small foot print.
## Why
Rava is designed to assist with websites with simple dynamic content. Where additional html may be pulled in or generated as the page is being rendered
## How
Rava allows you to bind functions and event handlers to a css selector, which will bind to content currently existing in the DOM tree but also to all additional matching elements that are added in the future. This provides a 'bind once' capability where you don't need to create additional code to handle asynchronous content.
