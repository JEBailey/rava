# Rava
Rava is a micro js library that allows you to extend and enahnce html elements.
## Why
Rave is designed to assist with websites with dynamic content. But the website isn't necessarily a one page application or a highly interactive page that would require a large extensive library such as React or Angular. Rava at it's core is less than 2k compressed. With no external dependencies

## How
Rava allows you to register a configuration against a selector so that this configuration is applied to all matching elements. It then registers itself and monitors for any additional matching elements that may be dynamically added after the first call, which makes it extremely useful for content that is being pulled in asynchronously.
