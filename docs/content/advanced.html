    As part of a Rava binding, Rava assigns a data object that is passed to all event handlers whenever that handler
    is triggered. This data object can be a unique object, or a shared object that is passed to all matches of a
    selector.

    By declaring the data object in the configuration you will share that object with all rava bindings

    <pre class="box prettyprint lang-js">
rava.bind("#example",{
    // heres all rava bindings will have access to data.count
    data : {
        count : 0,
    }
});
    </pre>

    By not declaring anything. Rava will automatically generate a unique data object for each instance of a binding.
