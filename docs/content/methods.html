        Unlike other options, the method configuration doesn't support a scoped method of declaration. All methods
        declared are mapped directly onto the primary binding.

        The traditional way of declaring functions is to use the methods Object
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                methods : {
                    basicFunctionDecl : function() {
                        //do stuff
                    }
                }
            }
        </pre>

        To reduce depth the configuration object now supports direct mapping of any functions that are not keyed to a
        specific feature

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                basicFunctionDecl : function(){
                    //do stuff
                }
            }
        </pre>
