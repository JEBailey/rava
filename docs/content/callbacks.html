        As part of a Rava binding, Rava assigns a data object that is passed to all event handlers whenever that handler
        is triggered. This data object can be a unique object, or a shared object that is passed to all matches of a selector. 

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                // since you are declaring a data object this data object will be shared by all matching bindings
                data : {
                    count : 0,
                }
            }
        </pre>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                // if you don't declare a data object a new object will be created for each match
            }
        </pre>
        In addition to an object declaration you can use a function to generate the data object. The function is called on each primary binding.

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                data : function(){
                    //do something spectacular
                }
            }
        </pre>
