        Callbacks are part of the lifecycle management that Rava allows you to do. There are three lifecycle events that rava pays attention to.
        <ul>
            <li>created</li>
            <li>added</li>
            <li>removed</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="box prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                // since you are declaring a data object this data object will be shared by all matching bindings
                callbacks : {
                    created : function(data, element){
                        //on initial binding by Rava perform this callback.
                    },
                    added : function (data, element){
                        //when the element is added to the dom
                    },
                    removed : function (data,element) {
                        //when the element is removed from the dom
                    }
                }
            }
        </pre>
        The default behaviour is a new data object per binding. This default occurs if no data object is defined.
        <pre class="box prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                // if you don't declare a data object a new object will be created for each match
            }
        </pre>
        In addition to an object declaration you can use a function to generate the data object. The function is called on each primary binding.

        <pre class="box prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                data : function(){
                    //do something spectacular
                }
            }
        </pre>
