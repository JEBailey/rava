    Callbacks are part of the lifecycle management that Rava allows you to do. There are three lifecycle events that rava pays attention to.
    <ul>
        <li>created</li>
        <li>added</li>
        <li>removed</li>
    </ul>
    <pre class="box prettyprint lang-js">
rava.bind(".example",{
    // since you are declaring a data object this data object will
    // be shared by all matching bindings
    callbacks : {
        created : function(data, element){
            //on initial binding by Rava perform this callback.
        },
        added : function (data, element){
            //when the element is added to the dom
        },
        removed : function (data,element) {
            //when the element is removed from the dom
        }
    }
});
    </pre>
    You may also scope the lifecycle events so that you can trigger a function when a lifecycle event occurs on another element
    <pre class="box prettyprint lang-js">
rava.bind(".example",{
    callbacks : {
        "a[href] " : {
            created : function(data, element){
                //when this element is found and bound, perform a callback to this function
                //with 'this' being the original ".example" element
            },
        },
    }
});
    </pre>
