    <section>
        As part of a Rava binding, Rava assigns a data object that is passed to all event handlers whenever that handler
        is triggered. This data object can be a unique object, or a shared object that is passed to all matches of a
        selector.

        By declaring the data object in the configuration you will share that object with all rava bindings

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                // heres all rava bindings will have access to data.count
                data : {
                    count : 0,
                }
            }
        </pre>

        By not declaring anything. Rava will automatically generate a unique data object for each instance of a binding.

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                //the worlds simplest code example.. Just don't configure data
            }
        </pre>

        In addition to an object declaration, or lack of one, you can use a function to generate the data object. The
        function is called on each primary binding.

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                data : function(){
                    //do something spectacular
                }
            }
        </pre>
