        <h2 class="subtitle">Event Configuration with 'events'</h2>
        Event Handling was designed so that the Rava bound object could listen and react to events occuring not only
        from the bound object itself, but from child objects, or an object located anywhere on the page.

        There are multiple ways to define Event handlers in the configuration object. The first is to define an
        Events object which holds a list of events and the associated function to call.
        <br>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                events : {
                    click : function(event){
                        //respond to click;
                    },
                    submit : function(event,data) {
                        //something
                    },
                }
            }
        </pre>
        <br>
        This will register an event listener directly on the rava bound element. But what if you want to listen to a
        click occuring on a child element?
        <br>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                events : {
                    ":scope foo > bar " : {
                        click : function(event){
                            //  located specifically as a child of the original bound element
                            // 'this' in this context still applies to the original bound rava element 
                        },
                    },
                    ".foobar" : {
                        submit : function(event,data) {
                            // anywhere on the page
                            // 'this' in this context still applies to the original bound rava element 
                        },
                    }

                }
            }
        </pre>
        <br>
        By adding a selector and an object containing event definitions we can now have our bound element listen and
        respond to events happening anywhere on the page.
        <br>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Using the 'on_' prefix</h2>
        There is a short hand version to declare an event listener by using the 'on_' prefix.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                on_click : function(event){
                    // do something for a click
                },
                on_submit : function(event,data) {
                    // do something for an event
                },
            }
        </pre>

        Using the 'on_' prefix allows us to bypass the events structure and produces a more concise view. It also
        allows us to group by the event type itself

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                on_click :{
                    ":scope foo > bar " : function(event){
                        // do something for a click on a child.
                    },
                    ".foobar" : function(event){
                        // do something for a click on this element 
                        // that's somewhere on the page.
                    },
                },
            }
        </pre>

        <h2>Function short hand</h2>
        Rather than declaring the function directly, you can use a string to identify the function by it's name.

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
            {
                on_click : "clickHandler"
                on_click :{
                    ":scope foo > bar " : "clickHandler"
                    ".foobar" : "clickHandler2"
                },
                methods : {
                    clickHandler :function(event){
                        //
                    },
                    clickHandler2 : function(event,data) {
                        //
                    }
                }
            }
        </pre>
        When you're using a string identifier it will look for the corresponding method on the rava bound element.
        This is an important distinction between a string identifier and the function delcaration. In both cases the
        functions are executed in the context of the bound element. However with a string declaration the method has
        to a method on the element, either one that is pre-existing to the binding or one that is declared with a
        method declaration.
